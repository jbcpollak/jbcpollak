I'm mostly posting this for my own future reference, but if you'd like to get a feeling for the Chinese expat experience, or how to do business in China in general, [chinageeks.org](http://chinageeks.org/) has an awesome collection of [blogs about China](http://chinageeks.org/blogroll/).

Because I'm into motorsports, and I'd like to get a donor-cycle, I've also been spending a fair amount of time on the forums at [mychinamoto.com](http://www.mychinamoto.com/).

Also, I found a [Linux Users Group](http://www.beijinglug.org/) here in Beijing, and even a [Hackerspace](http://flamingoeda.com/)! My lack of Chinese might be an obstacle at the Hackerspace, but if I have some time I'll go check it out.
