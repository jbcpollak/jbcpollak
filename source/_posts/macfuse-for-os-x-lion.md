I have [previously posted](http://www.offthehill.org/articles/2010/12/31/macfuse-for-64-bit-snow-leopard "MacFuse for 64-bit Snow Leopard") about using MacFuse with Snow Leopard, but if you have already upgraded to **OS X Lion**, you may be having trouble finding a version of FUSE to use.

Many people have commented that my [Snow Leopard build](http://www.offthehill.org/articles/2010/12/31/macfuse-for-64-bit-snow-leopard "MacFuse for 64-bit Snow Leopard") works fine, but according to [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/macfuse/browse_thread/thread/217a91cb665dfab5 "this thread") there is a new project called OSXFUSE that picks up where MacFuse left off. The project incorporates the source code below and already supports OS X Lion natively. The project is just getting started, but a beta binary release is promised in the next few days.

_I would recommend waiting for OSXFUSE._

You can find more information at the [project homepage](http://osxfuse.github.com/ "project homepage") (not online yet) or find the source code on [github](https://github.com/osxfuse "github").
