According to [Factcheck.org](http://Factcheck.org "Factcheck.org"), a non-partisan project of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, the McCain campaign is skewing the true, to say the least, about Obama voting to raise taxes.

The full details can be found [here](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/07/fact-check-did-obama-vote-94-times-for-higher-taxes-2/#more-23411), but this is the most telling quote to me:
> Annenberg says a close look at the record reveals that Obama has "voted consistently to restore higher tax rates on upper-income taxpayers but not on middle- or low-income workers."
In other words, sure, Obama supports raising the taxes on corporations and those people making more than 1 million dollars a year, but everyone else gets a tax cut. I don't know about you, but I'm not close to making a million a year (unlike McCain)!
