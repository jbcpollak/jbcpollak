I _hated_ Neil Stephenson's [Snow Crash](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553380958?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwoffthehill-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0553380958)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwoffthehill-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0553380958). Its trite, its crass, and it reads like an action movie elevator pitch. _Hiro Protagonist_ isn't a clever literary joke. Its a stupid name made up because the author couldn't think of something better. Its so bad I want to wretch thinking about it.

I also hate all the fan boys who think the virtual reality cyberpunk thing is so original. If you want to be cyberpunk, go read William Gibson's [Neuromancer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441012035?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwoffthehill-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0441012035)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwoffthehill-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0441012035) which invented the genre 8 years before _Snow Crash_ was written.

Don't get me wrong though, I don't hate Stephenson. Although _Snow Crash_ did put me off his books for more than a decade, I am just now wrapping up [The Diamond Age](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553380966?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwoffthehill-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0553380966)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwoffthehill-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0553380966). And I love it, for all the reasons I hated _Snow Crash_.

Unlike the earlier book, _The Diamond Age_ (which is only 3 years younger) is original, the characters have depth, and the pace  doesn't make the reader feel like they are watching a cheap action movie. And although _Hackworth_ is a bit of an obvious joke, the character names are all reasonably believable.

_The Diamond Age_ has broken my aversion to Stephenson's novels, and I look forward to reading more of them. As long as Hiro Protagonist doesn't make an appearance.
