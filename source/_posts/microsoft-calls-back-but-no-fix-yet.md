If you've been [following the drama](http://www.offthehill.org/articles/tag/xbox-live/) (and who hasn't?), you'll know I've been waiting with not-so-baited-breath for Microsoft tech support to get back to me about my Xbox Live account migration problem.

Well, this evening I got a call from Derek, in the XBox Support department of Microsoft Corporate. He said the regular support guys had been trying to get a hold of me for the last few days. That was news to me, since my phone handn't run and didn't show any miss calls, but whatever, at least someone finally did call.

**Unfortunately**<strong>, Derek didn't really have any news, he just told me what I already knew, which is that I probably sometime in the distant past tried to migrate my account via xbox.com and the account got corrupted. He took down all the possible email addresses I might have used as a Live ID, and said someone would get back to me again soon.

So, now I'm left waiting again. Derek did send me an email with his contact information, which I'll use if I don't hear anything by the end of the week.
