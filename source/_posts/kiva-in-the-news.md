AT&amp;T's Tech Channel website [did a video spot](http://techchannel.att.com/site/home/index.cfm?key=8ddafe838ef17c398a5e3563fe1d418c) about my company's robotic order fullfillment system. [check it out](http://techchannel.att.com/site/home/index.cfm?key=8ddafe838ef17c398a5e3563fe1d418c). _Update: We Kivan's can now publically talk about our latest client: [Walgreens](http://www.kivasystems.com/news-PR_walgreens.html)!_ We had a contract with Walgreen's for quite a while, but weren't allowed to talk about it till now._PS: _And if anyone at Kiva spots this, let me know how you found it!
