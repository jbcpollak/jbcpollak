I've built a binary of SqueezePlay 7.3 for OS X. It seems to work great, with one serious drawback: Music from the music library doesn't play! I just checked, and music from internet radio does work, and the menu sound effects work fine. Its just music from my library that doesn't play correctly!

You can try the binary out for yourself here, let me know in the comments if it works for you:

**Update:** Turns out its just m4a (AAC) files that don't play correctly. MP3's play great!
