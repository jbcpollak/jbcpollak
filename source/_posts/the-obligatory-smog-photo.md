There's nothing special about this photo, the smog level wasn't particularly high Saturday (it was '320' according to the [US Embassy smog meter](http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/070109air.html) and their [twitter feed](http://twitter.com/beijingair), but it gives you an idea what the view down the street on a typical day in Beijing looks like:

Except on rare "Blue Sky Days", the sky pretty much always has that white hazy look to it.
