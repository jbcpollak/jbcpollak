I tried [ADBWeatherPlus](http://www.happyjackroad.net/pocketpc/weatherPlus/help/weatherhelp.htm) for a few minutes in my T-Mobile Wing, and I couldn't get it set up. Maybe I'm not following the directions correctly, but the screen says 'Add a location', but when I try and add a location, I get as far as selecting the US, then Massachusetts, then my town. When I click 'Next', I get a dialog box that says something about "Fatal, no message".

So I gave up.
