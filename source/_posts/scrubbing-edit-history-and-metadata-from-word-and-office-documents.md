Many people don't realize, but Microsoft Office tracks the history of your documents, and can be configured to store hidden comments and other editing notes. Office documents also track what is called _metadata_, such as the author and organization where the document was created.

It can sometimes be really embarrassing to share a document with someone, only to have them discover your previous comments.
