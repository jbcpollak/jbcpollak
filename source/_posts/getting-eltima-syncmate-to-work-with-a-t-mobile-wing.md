I struggled with this for a long time, but it turn out its quite simple to get Eltima SyncMate to talk to your T-Mobile Wing. This might be applicable to other Windows Mobile devices as well... IÂ initially had trouble getting the program to 'see' my phone.It turned out the problem was with a bad setting on the phone itself. To correct it, go into Settings, then on the Connection tab click USB to PC. Make sure the box labeled <span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Enable advanced network functionality</span>Â is checked.One that is done, SyncMate should be able to 'see' your phone.Unfortunately, I spotted some other problems with SyncMate:Â 

*   Groups within groups are not synced to the phone.
*   Only one iCal calendar is handled
*   Todo entries are not synced to the phone.Â
