Sharon and I went for a nice lunch, it was as fancy as any "normal dinner out" in Boston, and the total cost was 54rmb, or about $8\. Still, _tai gui le!_ (too expensive!) The menu offered some intriguing dishes, such as _Mushroom Rape_, but we didn't try any this time.

No photos today since I didn't get out much.

I think the stress of traveling is making me sick, I'm not feeling too well.
