I went on the March [Critical Mass](http://www.bostoncriticalmass.org/) ride this last week. I can't say I'm a hard core biker, but there is something fantastically cool about riding around downtown Boston with 300 bikers shouting "Who's streets? - Our Streets!" to the honking of irate commuters.

I'm too much of a wuss to take shots while ON my bike, but I grabbed this on the way to the ride:
