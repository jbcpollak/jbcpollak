While waiting in a clothing department, I was able to ssh to my Dreamhost account and then use lynx to download (and install) the wordpress mobile edition and mobileadmin plugins.

Now I can easily post from anywhere (And with Shozu, even photos) And iPhone and Win-Mobile users can read offthehill anywhere.

That should double my readership (2x Zero is still Zero)
