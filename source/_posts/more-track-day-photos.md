Here are some "more pictures From the track day":http://www.offthehill.org/galleries/TrackDayOct2007/index.html

Over all it was a great day, I got about 80 minutes of driving time in four 20 minute sessions. I learned a lot and by the end of the forth session I was really driving a lot more smoothly.

I need to work on my shifting, making sure I'm in the right gear before I enter the turn, so I don't have to shirt during the turn. Other than that, I think I'm doing fine for a beginner. Can't wait till next year!
