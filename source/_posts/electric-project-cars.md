Someone reads my website! Yeah!

Since at least a significant percentage of my reader ship is at least slightly interested in electric vehicle projects, here is a brain dump of links I've come across in the past.

SAAB content first _of course_.

"Walter Kern and Dave Hosmer's electric Sonett III":http://www.saabhistory.com/2006/12/08/1974-saab-sonett-iii-electric-car/

"The Duke EV Club's electric Sonett III":http://www.duke.edu/~syk/ee149/carinfo.htm

"Suckamps EV Racing":http://www.suckamps.com/ - Home of a Postal Van converted to EV Drag-Racing Monster. The site also has a good 'links' page with sources for parts and other EV projects.

"AC Propulsion":http://www.acpropulsion.com/ - A commerical EV fabricator

"National Electric Drag Racing Association":http://www.nedra.com/
