No really, its a really big restaurant:

I've got to apologize for the cultural insensitivity, because I know its inappropriate, but I find the name of this restaurant _really, really_ funny.

I admit it, I really like junior-high level humor. "Your mom" jokes and penile humor _never_ get old. Which is pretty amazing, considering the prevalence of surnames in China which happen to coincide with humorously euphemistic English words for male genitalia. You would think China would serve as a 1.3 billion person strong form of [exposure therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy) for me, but so far it hasn't been very effective.
