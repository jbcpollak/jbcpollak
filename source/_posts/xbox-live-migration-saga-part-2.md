Last week I [wrote](http://www.offthehill.org/articles/2009/01/14/cannot-migrate-live-to-an-xbox-360/) about my experience trying to [fix my broken XBox Live account](http://www.offthehill.org/articles/2009/01/14/cannot-migrate-live-to-an-xbox-360/).

Today I got a call back from a support supervisor today at 6:00 but I missed the call, he asked to call back 800-4MY-XBOX. If you call, you must remember to say "agent", at the initial menu so you can skip through most of the annoying computerized questions.

An agent at the basic support verified my billing information and transferred me to an XBox Supervisor named _Jackie_, she told me escalated support is doing research on my account and that I should expect a call back in 2-5 business days, possibly longer. When I asked if I could call them directly she _laughed_ and said "They are an offline support team." Yeah, right.

So now I'll hold my breath for another call back.
