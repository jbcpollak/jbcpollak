<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; line-height: 24px">I accidentally asked my ActiveSync to sync all of my calendar entries. It made my WM5 phone run out of memory. Then, I wanted to delete my calendar and start again.</span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; line-height: 24px" class="Apple-style-span">I searched all over the web for how to do this, and couldn't find anything, so just in case someone else is looking for things like <span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">windows mobile erase entire calendar delete calendar file</span> et cetera, I hope you find this!</span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; line-height: 24px" class="Apple-style-span">All you need to do is go into File Explorer, into My Device, and find a file called pim. This has ALL of your contacts and calendar appointments. You can't erase it because its in use.</span>Â Instead,Â <span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; line-height: 24px" class="Apple-style-span">rename it to pim2\. Then do a soft reset. You can now delete the pim2 file, and that will free up quite a bit of memory.</span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; line-height: 24px" class="Apple-style-span">There, now I hope others who need this will find it!</span>
