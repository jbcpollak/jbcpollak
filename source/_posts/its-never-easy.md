Last Wednesday the brakes gave out (gently!) on my '72 Sonett. It turns out the steel braided line to the left front wheel had been worn through. I ordered a new set of lines from [West of Sweden](http://www.wmsbrg.com/sweden/) and today they arrived, so I figured I'd be back on the road tomorrow.

Unfortunately its never that easy...

{% flickr 223375998 %} The good part is that the old brake line came off easily. The bad, and confusing, part is that the brake line looks nothing like the replacement lines. I trust West Of Sweden sent me the right parts, so I can only assume the previous owner came up with some sort of alternative solution.

{% flickr 223376020 %} The male fitting on the chassis fits the old brake line, and I can't imagine how a female fitting would look on the chassis. Also, how is that nut supposed to come off? Its in-set in that channel, so its impossible to get a wrench in there.

{% flickr 223376042 %} Does this back of the caliper. Is this correct? I was concerned the fitting might have been drilled out and had some sort of sleeve fit into it.
