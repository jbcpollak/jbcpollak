My Corrado's Sunroof was completely non-functional, not to mention solid instead of glass, and with a _really_ ratty headliner-insert.

I bought a glass sunroof frame I found on Craigslist for $50 and stuck it in... **[Here are pictures](http://www.offthehill.org/galleries/Corrado/SunroofSwap1/index.html)** of how that went.

It turns out I learned a few things with this project...

h3\. Finding Glass

The Corrado's roofline matches the Passat roofline, not the Jetta roof line. The sunroof I got was marked 'A3', ( _A_ in the lower left of the label, _3_ in the lower right ) which means it came out out of a Jetta. The glass from a Jetta has a slightly steeper build and it wont seal well in the corners. If you live in a warm climate where it never rains, it might be ok, but not around here. **Look for glass that has a _B_ in the lower left of the label.**

h3\. Wind Deflector

The newer frames have a wind deflector with two oval holes cut in them. This wind deflector looks a bit cooler than the old style, but the hinges on them are a bit different and interfere with the roof line of the car, making the sunroof frame not fit flush against the roof on the front edge. I think if you _really_ wanted to, you could make it fit by modifying the hinges or cutting a small (it would be tiny) section of the roof line on the car, but I didn't want to mess with it, so I used an old-style wind deflector.

h3\. Inspect Your Frame Before You Install It

As you can see from my sunroof photos, my frame didn't have rear drains. I have no idea where they went, but don't be like me... inspect your frame **before** you install it! Not only were the drains missing, but the metal guides that pull the frame up and down were broken. You'll need to look inside the guides to see this as you move the motor with a screw driver or allen wrench (depending on motor version). Basically that whole frame was a waste of money.

h3\. Final Results

In the end I found another, functioning sunroof with B3 glass for $100 in New Hampshire, and installation went fine, after I did all the exploration and research.
