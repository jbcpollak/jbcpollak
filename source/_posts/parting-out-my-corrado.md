**Update: My Corrado is now gone, off to a new home. I don't have many Corrado specific parts left. Sorry, and thanks for the interest!**

I'm sorry to say, but I've got to throw in the towel. I've spent to
much money and time on my Corrado and could never get it running, and
its distracted me from my real toy, my Saab Sonett. I loved the
Corrado when I could drive it, but its just too much now to work on.

I've put ads up on the "VW Vortex":http://forums.vwvortex.com/zerothread?id=3419940,
"Bay State Dubs":http://forums.baystatedubs.com/viewtopic.php?t=518 and "Maine Vw Scene":http://www.mainevwscene.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15237

Its basically a complete '91 G60 Corrado with a 2.0 liter 9A block
turbo engine swapped in. I have the full interior including both a B3
glass sun roof, manual seat belts from Germany (including all the
trim pieces), as well as the original sunroof and belts.

If you'd like anything, please let me know, I'll take best and first
offers. On interior OEM stuff, I'll be very reasonable. On the go
fast parts, well, I know what I spent on them, and I know how little
they are used, so please be reasonable.
