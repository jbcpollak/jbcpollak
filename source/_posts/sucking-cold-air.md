I'm not a big fan of trucks, but my friend "James":http://www.jfdavidson.com/ did a good write-up on his Chevy Colorado cold-air intake install, so if your interested, "here is a link":http://www.jfdavidson.com/truck/index.html.

If you've ever thought of dabbling with car modifications, a cold air intake is one of the easiest things to get started with. It won't turn your Neon into a race car, but it'll make a small difference, and combining it with a few other changes and a computer ugrade can create a lot of power.
