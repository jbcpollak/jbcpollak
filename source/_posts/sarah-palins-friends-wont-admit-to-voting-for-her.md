A friend pointed me to an [article in the Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/09/abc-interviews-palins-clo_n_125062.html)Â today that included a video clip with her closest friends discussing politics. 3 out of 4 of them refused to say who they were voting for. Also, they revealed Sarah Palin <span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">hates cats.</span>Â Damning evidence if I ever heard it.Â Also included at the end of the clip is a bit where PalinÂ says the war in Iraq was "from God". Thanks for the news flash, I thought it was from some guy we didn't elect with a daddy complex.
