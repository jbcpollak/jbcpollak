Some co-workers brought up the idea of creating an electric pusher-trailer to take the load off a gas-powered car... you know, incase you wanted a hybrid but couldn't afford a Prius... or maybe you just can't give up your Ferrari, but the gas bills are starting to get to you.

Anyway, I was curious if anyone else had ever thought of this, so I did some digging. It turns out no one has ever built an electric pusher, but the concept of pushing a car with a trailer is "nothing new":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusher_trailer , except that usually its an electric car being pushed by a gas trailer.

"Here":http://www.mrsharkey.com/pusher.htm are a few "examples":http://www.jstraubel.com/EVpusher/EVpusher2.htm .

I did "find":http://www.electric-bikes.com/bidwell.htm two electric pusher "trailers":http://www.geocities.com/vancyclist/PT50.html for bicycles however.
