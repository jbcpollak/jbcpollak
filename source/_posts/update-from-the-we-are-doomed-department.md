Sweet:** I loveÂ Fear Mongering!**

Since I haven't mentioned that the world (and us, by association) are doomed lately, I thought I'd share this little gem, sent to me by a co-worker:

[Has Sarah Palin Been Picked as the Titular Head of the Coming Police State?](http://www.alternet.org/story/100069/has_sarah_palin_been_picked_as_the_titular_head_of_the_coming_police_state/?page=entire)

Basically, Sarah Palin is the forthcoming puppet president of a cabal bent on controlling American through fear. Sounds like _severe haircut lady_Â from [Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com/ "Craphound: Cory Doctorow")'s book [Little Brother](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/ "Little Brother")Â (which you can download for free under the Creative Commons licenses)
