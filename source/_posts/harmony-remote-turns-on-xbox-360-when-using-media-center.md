I have Logitech Harmony Remote for XBox 360, which I use to control my TV, TiVo, Xbox 360, and a computer I use to run XBMC. The problem is, I'm using a Microsoft Media Center PC remote receiver with the PC, and whenever I control the PC with the remote, the XBox turns on.

It turns out the solution is actually pretty simple: By default, the XBox recognizes both Media Center PC and XBox remote signals, but you can set it to only recognize XBox signals if you want.

On your XBox, go into system settings, and at the bottom of the list you'll find an option to configure the remote control. Select the XBox 360 Remote Only option and you'll be all set.
