I found an article [here](http://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-thinks-you-are-disposable-118047.phtml) covering some of the same issues I've been having with Microsoft's XBox Live service.

Its unbelievable how long these service problems have existed, but I guess MS has no financial incentive to rectify the problems.
