Getting 3 new FREE bikes! Ok, not so new, actually, they are down right old, but still, the look pretty cool. First up is a Peugeot Cadre Allege women's bike, which I might refurbish for my wife, or sell. If nothing else, the lion and Peugeot decals are pretty damn cool.

Read on for the other two...

I also got my Mom's Nishiki road bike. I can't figure out what model or vintage it is, but it might be an 'International', and its probably from the '70s.

The last bike is a "Windsor International". I've never heard of Windsor, but a bit of web research indicates they import OEM branded Chinese and Tiawanese bikes. It has a cool vintage Cannondale front mounted pack and the frame is in pretty good shape.
