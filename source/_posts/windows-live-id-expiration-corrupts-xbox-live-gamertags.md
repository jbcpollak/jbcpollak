While [waiting for XBox support to call me back](http://www.offthehill.org/articles/2009/01/14/cannot-migrate-live-to-an-xbox-360/), I looked into what other people have been saying online about my problem.

First, I found an article that claims [Microsoft is refusing to fix a broken live account](http://nextgn.com/2009/01/03/microsoft-refuses-to-fix-broken-xbox-live-account/). The original forum post that triggered that article is [here](http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showthread.php?t=49775). Apparently, Windows Live ID's can expire, and once they expire, they can't be recovered.

**Apparently, if they've expired, the account information for your gamertag can't be modified any more!** _How F-ing stupid is that?_

Other people (
[one](http://www.hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1362047), [two](http://www.avforums.com/forums/xbox-360/901444-please-help-im-my-wits-end-gamertag-recovery.html), [three](http://msnemailchange.blogspot.com/2007/02/xbox-live-kills-off-accounts-after-60.html)) all seem to be having the same problem too!

My optimism on having this issue resolved is dwindling.
