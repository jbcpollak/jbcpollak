Getting on a plane a few days ago, I overheard this conversation between the two guys in the row in front of me:

**Ass**: "Do you know how to use Febreeze?"
**Passenger**: "Excuse me?"
**Ass**: "Febreeze, you spray it on stuff and it gets rid of smells"
**Passenger**: "Are you saying I smell?"
**Ass**: "Yeah, your jacket, or something you're wearing"

Something **DID** smell, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't his jacket, and the smell soon went away. Anyway, what kind of way to broach a conversation is that? With a total stranger? About _body odor_?
