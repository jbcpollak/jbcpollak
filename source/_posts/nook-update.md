My Hanukah present has so far been a success. My hope was that an eBook reader would get me to read more. Although I've tapered off a bit, since it arrived in December, I've finished three books:

*   _[Makers](0765312794)_, by Cory Doctorow
*   _[Saturn's Children](0441015948)_, by Charles Stross
*   _[Neverwhere](0060557818)_, by Neil Gaiman

I highly recommend all three, although _[Makers](0765312794)_ struck me a bit too much like a remake of Ayn Rand's _The Fountainhead_.

I find myself wishing there were graphic novels available in eBook format.
