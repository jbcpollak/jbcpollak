While trying to find a solution to my [Xbox live problem](http://www.offthehill.org/articles/2009/01/21/xbox-live-migration-saga-part-2/), I found some information online about getting through to escalated XBox live support. So far it hasn't been very useful, and I haven't tried the big-guns yet, but here is what I know:

**Tier 2 Support**

First, I found [here](http://consumerist.com/5007862/how-to-quickly-contact-intelligent-life-at-xbox-customer-service) that you can try calling 'X-Box Escalated Support'. Their number is 866-506-3826\. They have limited hours, between 6 am and 4 pm PST, which is a bit of a pain if you live on the east coast and have to do any amount of commuting. You'll need a support reference number, so make sure you called Tier 1 support and got one.

In my experience, when I call (within their hours of course) and give my case number, it goes straight to a busy signal. **Not helpful, or friendly.** I've tried in the morning, mid-day, and even the evening. I had to work from home one day to try it, and I never got through to a human.

Another note about that number: When you say "operator" or "agent", or give anything that doesn't match the expected response to the computer's question, the system responds with "Thanks for calling microsoft, goodbye", **then hangs up on you**.

So, if you give that number a try, give the computer exactly what it expects to hear, and good luck.

**Tier 3**

I found a reference online to Tier 3 support in Washington as well. Their number isÂ 1-888-236-0927, and you'll need both a support reference number _and an extension_ to get through the computer system.

I haven't had much luck with this number either, but then again, I don't have an extension. I've been making progress trying to guess one though!Â Entering an invalid extension twice gets you a message saying "please hold for the next available agent", and it puts you on hold. I thought, I was making progress, but after 25 minutes of listening to annoying music, I had to admit defeat and hang up. **Ugh!**

However, today I did some research online and found out a bit of a pattern for the extensions. They all start with 70 and have four digits. I found a few complete extensions online, but when I tried them, they were disconnected or the people at those numbers had moved to new jobs.

Here are the extensions I know about, please comment on more if you have them:

*   7033 - Went straight to voice mail, so I left a polite message
*   7034 - Went straight to voice mail, so I left a polite message
*   7035 - Invalid extension
*   7036 - Brad, no longer in this position
*   7040 - Empty mailbox, can leave a message but no name associated with box
*   7041 - Unrecognized
*   7075 - Frank, moved to a more internal management position
*   7087 - Unrecognized
**The Big Guns**

I haven't gotten this far yet, but if you are really pissed, you can always try bringing in the big guns. I found contact information for a few Microsoft executives online. I haven't tried contacting them yet, but if this is unresolved next week, I'll give it a shot:

*   robbieb@microsoft.com- Robert (Robbie) Bach- PRESIDENT, ENT &amp; DEVICES DIV
*   donm@microsoft.com - Don Mattrick- SVP, INTERACTIVE ENT. BUSINESS
*   jabell@microsoft.com - Jeff Bell - CVP GLOBAL MKT INTERACTIVE ENT
**Other Ideas**

I'm out of ideas, so if you are reading this and have a suggestion, please let me know!
