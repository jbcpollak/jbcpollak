## Interesting Coding Challenges

Here are some example projects I've written as demonstrations for various companies.

*  [ReactJS-Based Depression Screener](https://github.com/jbcpollak/react-depression-screener)
*  [A NodeJS Service to run Javascript in Docker Containers](https://github.com/jbcpollak/docker-microservices)
*  [C++ Blob Analysis Exercise](https://github.com/jbcpollak/blob_boundaries)

## Interesting Technical Articles

*  [Java: Static Variables are WRONG (Almost Always)](/2011/06/03/java-static-variables-are-wrong-almost-always/)

## My Resume

I used the [jsonresume.org](http://jsonresume.org/) project to generate my resume. If you just want to take a peak, download it here:

*  [PDF](/CV - Joshua Chaitin-Pollak.pdf)

If you'd like to compile your own copy of my resume, or just see how it works, here are the relevant repositories:

*  [The Source Repository](https://github.com/jbcpollak/jbcpollak-resume)
*  [One Page Theme](https://github.com/jbcpollak/jsonresume-theme-onepage)
   (I made a few tweaks to the theme to support multi-page printing - these were merged into the upstream repository)
