_**Update:** The Sonett has been sold! Thank you for your interest!_

This 1972 SAAB Sonett III is in excellent mechanical condition with many period and modern performance and comfort upgrades. It is fantastic fun to drive and very reliable. The chassis is absolutely solid with no rust.

The car was refreshed by the previous owner in the mid-'80s with new upholstery and the engine was rebuild with many MSS-go-fast parts including new a new cam and larger valves. I have most of the receipts and specs. The car was fitted with a 32/36 DGAV water-choke which works very well and makes good power. A dyno chart showing just over 80 hp can be seen in the gallery.

Since owning the car I have done the following modifications:

*   MSS exhaust system
*   MSS-springs
*   New shocks (adjustable Koni up front and KYB in the back)
*   Moto-Lita steering wheel with SAAB griffin emblem
*   Front Stainless Steel brakelines from West-of-Sweden (I have the rears but not installed)
*   Radio-delete Dashboard plate
*   Alpine Radio from 2004 installed in glovebox
*   ATL Fuel Cell and Electric Fuel Pump installed in the trunk
*   Rebuilt Brake Master Cylinder in 2010
*   New masonite floor boards
*   New trunk and hood weatherstripping from Jack Ashcraft

I always change the oil at least twice a year, or more-often if I have driven the car many miles. Coolant is changed ever few years.

In addition to all this, the car includes may spare parts, all the original documentation, and a Sonett supplement to the SAAB factory repair manual. The original fuel-tank is available if you want it.

I also have two additional performance pieces that are available under negotiation:

*   A rear axle with camber adjusted by MSS for performance.
*   MSS Widened Soccer-ball wheels. Widened to 5.5" to accomodate performance tires

There are a few negatives to the car:

*   The car is not an ideal concourse car for many reasons, not the least being that white was not an OEM color.
*   The paint doesn't look bad for 20 years old, but it does have some chips and spider cracks.
*   The fuel pressure regulator blocks installation of the windshield-wiper fluid reservoir. An adapter plate can be made easily to relocate it.
*   The radio in the glovebox is held in by foam padding, a mounting plate would look more finished.
*   The fuel cell is large enough to prevent the normal trunk deck from being installed, I was going to make a lifted one to cover it.
*   The hole in the body where the fuel-filler spout was needs to be filled. I have a blanking plate for this that needs to be painted.
