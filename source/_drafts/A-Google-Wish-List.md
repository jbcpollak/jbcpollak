After having played with Google+ a bit, I've thought of a few features I imagine are already in the works, and that I'm really looking forward to.

## Circle Enhancements

This is kind of a no-brainer, but it would be great to put a circle within another circle. This would allow you to have ever widening circles, which will make it easier to select how wide a group you wish to share your posts with.

I'm sure this and much more (Smart Circles anyone?) will be coming in the near future. Creating Circles is effectively tagging your contacts, but it would be great if you could create a Smart Circle of everyone with the same company name in the address book, or of everyone who lived within a 10 mile radius of you. Imagine a Circle of all of your contacts who graduated from the same school, or everyone who has the same profession!

## Circle Visualization Tools

I can imagine all sorts of powerful tools for slicing and dicing your contacts and circles. At a basic level, filters to help you find which contacts aren't in circles, and which are in too many would be useful. In addition, it would be cool to see the interconnected graph of your contacts, and how they relate to each other.

## Public Circles

Public circles (ie, a circle you can add yourself to and you can share content with) would eliminate the need for mailing lists and websites like Google Groups. Public Circles could be moderated and archived, and a mailing list interface could be supported, but being able to share content with a public group in the same interface as you share with your friends could be a very powerful tool.

## Smart Stream Filters

## Address Book Integration

## Management API
